        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p>
          For a number of years I was captain of the Starship Enterprise. As
          commander, I was responsible for the safety of all on board, but also
          as captain, I kept losing people with red shirts. Not ideal, but it
          happens.
        </p>
        <p>
          After retiring from the service, I bought a house boat and got myself
          out of bad situations with my trusty Swiss Army Knife and a roll of
          duct tape. My friend also had a plane, which was fun.

        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>My fun hobbies include but are not limited to:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>Juggling</li>

          There are too many to list, but you get the gist of things from the
          list above.
